  title: 'OCR and Document Classification API'
  description: This API provides services to initiate the processing of a document (image or pdf) to classify and obtain the relevant data within it. This processing is asynchronous, so this API also provides services to check the status and the actual result after the processing. Additionally, this API provides an endpoint that allows the user to provide feedback on successful extracted data.
